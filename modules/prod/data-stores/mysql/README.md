Please note that this code was written for Terraform 0.14.x.

## Quick start

**Please note that this example will deploy real resources into your AWS account. We have made every effort to ensure 
all the resources qualify for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), but we are not responsible for any
charges you may incur.** 


Open `main.tf`, uncomment the `backend` configuration, and fill in the name of your S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, and
the path to use for the Terraform state file.

Deploy the code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Clean up when you're done:

```
terraform destroy
```
