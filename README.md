## Quick start
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)


In `variables.tf`, fill in the name of the S3 bucket and key where the remote state is stored for the MySQL database
(you must deploy the configuration in [data-stores/mysql](../../data-stores/mysql) first):

```hcl
variable "db_remote_state_bucket" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket used for the database's remote state storage"
  type        = string
  default     = "<YOUR BUCKET NAME>"
}

variable "db_remote_state_key" {
  description = "The name of the key in the S3 bucket used for the database's remote state storage"
  type        = string
  default     = "<YOUR STATE PATH>"
}
```

Deploy the code:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

When the `apply` command completes, it will output the DNS name of the load balancer. To test the load balancer:

```
curl http://<alb_dns_name>/
```

Clean up when you're done:

```
terraform destroy
```
